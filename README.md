# CV-webpage
I made a cv page with HTML &amp; CSS

This is my CV
I made all pngs myself. Because I couldn't find what I wanted.
It's quietly difficult made my own png. But I did it.


firstly, I desgined christmas concept of CV. Because I like green and red. These two colors imagined christmas.
But I changed my mide. I made desert island png to show that I'm potentional person like a treasure that hidden in the island.

*Difficulties*
1. control images _ didn't fixed
I've tried my webpage can Zoom in and Zoom out.
But still don't know how to control lightbulb images that located top of the page.

2. float _ fixed
I adjusted float into div(middle_container). 
It didn't work and ruined my page.
So, I thought it would be better not to use. but I didn't want to give up.
I tried again and again and I figured out I should adjust in images.
Finally, it did it!

3. message box _ fixed
I figured out when I used link with button, I have not use <link> or <a>.
Now I know I have to use onClick.
